Fry Goergiander was a stock broker hedgehog working in the slums of New Delphia. Today was his last day of work before he was moving with his friend to the tropical city of Neo Vegas. Everything was going smoothly until Jamie came in to the office. Jamie had different plans for Fry's last day of of work. "Fry! Before you go, I need to tell you something", Jamie yelled. "You're in incredible danger! You must come with me at once." Fry didn't believe Jamie, but it was his last day so he wanted to see where this was going. Fry followed Jamie through the slums until they ended at the door of a dungeon who's door was broken off.
